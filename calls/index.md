# You're probably here because we're trying to set up a call together.

You might not realise this, but I'm 'profoundly deaf' in both ears and wear hearing aids/[implants](https://medium.com/@jon_lay/new-ears-please-week-1-with-a-cochlear-implant-5c2c5ef248e2).

That's why I share this page before jumping on a call. Thanks for understanding!

## Dealbreakers

Please make sure you can do all of these things. If you can't, I won't be able to take the call with you:

* Please make sure you're set up to have a <strong>video call</strong>. I can't follow audio-only calls.
* Please make sure you're <strong>somewhere quiet</strong>. Background noise is a real problem for me.
* Please <strong>use an external microphone</strong>, rather than just your computer's built in mic. Even an iPhone headset mic is better than your laptop's default.

### Tips

A few things it's worth mentioning

* I'm from London, and find it easiest to hear English accents (particularly London ones). If you have a strong regional accent (even a strong Northern English one, I'll probably struggle).
* I'll rarely take a call with more than 1-2 people.
* I'm highly likely to ask you to repeat something, at least a few times while we're talking. Sorry, in advance!
* It might be the case that I ask you to type out a phrase or sentence into the IM window if I can't quite catch it when you're saying it out loud.
* And finally, if we can't manage to carry out a conversation with voice chat (it usually happens if you have a really strong accent or can't manage the 'dealbreakers' up above), we might have to fall back to a coversation where you type your answers, and I speak my response (or we both IM)
