# You're probably reading this because we're trying to set up a call together

You might not be aware, but I'm deaf in both ears and wear hearing aids/implants.

That's why I share this page before jumping on a call. Thanks for understanding!

## Dealbreakers

Please make sure you can do all of these things. If you can't, I won't be able to take the call with you:

* Please make sure you're set up to have a <strong>video call</strong> using Zoom. I can't easily follow audio-only calls.
* Please make sure you're <strong>somewhere quiet</strong>, without a lot of background noise.
* Please <strong>use an external microphone</strong>, rather than just your computer's built in mic or a conference room microphone. Even an iPhone headset mic is better than your laptop's default.
