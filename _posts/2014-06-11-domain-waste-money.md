You’d think this was common sense, but some people seem to be building a business entirely around the fact that they’ve bought a great domain name. That’s madness.

I don’t visit websites because I think they have a cool URL, and typing that URL into my browser is a fun way to spend my time.

Pizza.com is [worth an absolute fortune](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/7331042.stm), but the content at that URL is rubbish. So why would I bother visiting it?

If you’ve got a launch budget of £100,000+ for your startup, then maybe at that point, you’ve got the kind of cash that will allow you to spend £5,000 (or more) on a domain name. But think about it—if your budget is actually closer to £30,000, you’re spending nearly 20% of your project budget on something which gets you no closer at all to meeting your users’ needs.

[Basecamp](http://basecamp.com), one of most successful, and widely used web products out there, managed to get along perfectly well for years with their _basecamphq.com_ domain, before they eventually picked up _basecamp.com_ recently. [Pitchfork](http://pitchfork.com/), a hugely influential music reviews site, did massively well despite a lot of people accidentally ending up on a farming website at _pitchfork.com_, while trying to reach _pitchforkmedia.com_. They also picked up their 'natural' domain name recently.

I think quite often, people massively overestimate the significance of a domain name, particularly when they're building a product which doesn't need to universally appeal to a low-tech audience. It's worth remembering that a sizeable number of users won't even type your URL into their browser, anyway--[they'll just Google it](http://readwrite.com/2008/07/17/will_mainstream_users_ever_learn). And some browsers are even [moving towards hiding more and more of the URL](http://www.cnet.com/news/safari-for-mac-to-hide-full-web-site-addresses-too/), these days.

It’s actually a little similar to some of the branding and identity work I get approached for by clients—obviously it’s great to work on great branding projects, and in the right circumstances, they can be very successful. But if a client (who is often bootstrapping their startup from their own pocket) comes to me asking to spend £10,000 coming up with the perfect brand identity for an online product with a very tight budget, I just can’t, in good conscience, allow them to do that. It’s in nobody’s interest to give poor advice, make a quick buck, and watch a startup fail while you pocket the cash.

So if you’re considering doing this, here’s a far better solution: save your money. Buy a workable domain name, even if it’s not quite as neat and tidy as you’d like (just [watch out for somewhat unstable TLD suffixes](http://techcrunch.com/2013/01/04/confirmed-art-sy-has-permanently-moved-to-artsy-net-due-to-ongoing-syrian-unrest/)).

Use that money where it can make a difference—put that precious cash into your product, rather than your domain—and if you make it big, come back and splash out on the domain name of your dreams later on. There’s no glory in failing 1 year in, because you built a shoddy product under the banner of a pretty brand.
