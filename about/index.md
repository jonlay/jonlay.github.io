#Talking

I've found from experience that it saves a whole lot of hassle if I'm upfront about the fact that I'm profoundly deaf and wear hearing aids in both ears, so find it difficult to hear certain conversations.

So to make things easier, I have a few personal rules and guidelines before I'll take a call, so that we can both avoid wasting our time. I used to email these to people, but here they are in a more convenient format.


##The dealbreakers

Unless we can manage the following, there's no point in us speaking, unfortunately!

* I won't take an audio call by itself--I need video, as well as audio, in order to have a chance of hearing you
* I can't take a call unless we're both in a quiet place--please try and minimise background noise
* You'll need to have some sort of microphone--a lot of people don't realise that the built-in microphone on your Mac sucks, big time.

##Things to keep in mind

* I'm from London, and find it easiest to hear English accents (particularly London ones). If you have a strong regional accent (even a strong Northen English one, I'll probably struggle)--I have family in Newcastle and even then, I can barely hear them!
* I'll rarely take a call with more than 1-2 people.
* I'm highly likely to ask you to repeat something, at least a few times while we're talking. Sorry, in advance!
* It might be the case that I ask you to type out a phrase or sentence into the IM window if I can't quite catch it when you're saying it out loud.

And finally, if we can't manage to carry out a conversation with voice chat (it usually happens if you have a really strong accent or can't manage the 'dealbreakers' up above), we might have to fall back to a coversation where you type your answers, and I speak my response (or we both IM).

Thanks for being understanding of this!
