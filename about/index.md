#Who am I?

A UX designer and developer by trade, I'm the founder of a UX design agency called <a href="http://hanno.co">Hanno</a>. These days I spend as much time thinking and writing about <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware">peopleware</a> as I do about software.

I'm a food and craft beer-loving Londoner who is currently based in Kuala Lumpur. No doubt, I'll look back on most of this writing in the future and cringe.
