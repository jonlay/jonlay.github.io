A quick blog powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and running on [Hikari](https://github.com/m3xm/hikari-for-Jekyll) for now (no need to reinvent the wheel).

## Running it

1. Navigate to the directory
2. `$ bundle`
3. `$ jekyll serve`

## Build tips

Use `$ jekyll serve -w` to watch for file changes when working.
