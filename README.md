A quick blog powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and running on [Hikari](https://github.com/m3xm/hikari-for-Jekyll) for now (no need to reinvent the wheel).

Largely being used to pull in my posts from my [company blog](http://hanno.co/logbook) and from [Medium](https://medium.com/@jon_lay).


## Running it

1. Navigate to the directory
2. `$ bundle`
3. '$ jekyll serve'

## Build tips

Use `$ jekyll serve -w` to watch for file changes when working.
